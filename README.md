This is my online developer CV/portfolio, built in December 2025.

It is built in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/). I used [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) to get started.

## Background

I built this website for myself, to showcase my web development skills, particularly React, Typescript and decoupled architecture.

I am developing my skills Next.js and Sanity and used the documentation and Learn Sanity track as a guide:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)
- [Sanity Learn](https://www.sanity.io/learn)

## Deployed on Vercel

I deployed this app using the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).

You can view the live product at [helena-developer.vercel.app/](https://helena-developer.vercel.app/)

## Local development

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
